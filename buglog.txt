Buglog (James):

Problem: Issues using batch script to launch boot image

Problem: Initializing GDT
https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux-Init-HOWTO-4.html
https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+gdt+initialize&oq=linux+gdt+initialize&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.3746j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
Problem: Undefined reference to gdt while doing lgdt gdt?
Solution: Check what is in .globl in .S file, contains pointer to gdt

Problem: Make output error -> sudo: unable to execute ./debug.sh: No such file or directory
Solution: https://piazza.com/class/k5nafawx3fj2v3?cid=628
Run 
dos2unix debug.sh
chmod +x debug.sh
make clean && make

Problem: #include x86_desc.h in asm .S file and set up descriptor pointer?
Solution: Pseudo descriptor format containing base address (first gdt entry) and limit (size of table - 1)

Problem: What is .align doing?
Solution: http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361290002364.htm

Problem: Issue with passing gdtr pseduo descriptor
Solution: Pad before gdt descriptor for gdtr

Problem: Still bootlooping
Solution: https://piazza.com/class/k5nafawx3fj2v3?cid=631, week8 discussion
RUN_TESTS macro, test is throwing fault on boot due to IDT calls failing, comment out run_tests macro

Problem: IDT linkage
Solution: arch/i386/kernel/head.S:367 -> It doesn't actually load idt - that can be done only after paging has been enabled and the kernel moved to PAGE_OFFSET. Interrupts are enabled elsewhere, when we can be relatively sure everything is ok.

Problem: Interrupt / trap vectors
4.8.3

Problem: How to test throw exceptions?
Solution: Divide by error -> a / 0 should throw an error

Problem: Print output displaying to top of screen after fully filled

Problem: Paging keeps crashing/boot looping
Solution: Improper video memory spacing, need to change something in lib.c
Solution2: Fixed paging; forgot to map video mem physical address to page's virtual address

Problem: Warnings on declaring structs within another struct if struct is not defined above it.
Solution: The struct being declared is moved above

Problem: strncmp had issues checking equality during filename check
Solution: Set equality condition on strncmp by checking equivalence with 0

Problem: Page fault when dir_entry_t type is declared on the open function as a pointer
Solution: Declared an instance of the object instead of a pointer, otherwise memory is not being used

Buglog (Michael)

Bug: The interrupt handlers were executing correctly, but sometimes for
the ones that don't pause afterwards they were causing weird crashes. This
was fixed by adding a an assembly wrapper around the c functions which
finish with IRET.

Bug: After implementing some PIC stuff, the qemu window would close during
the hlt-jmp loop. This was fixed by resetting some masks on the PIC so that
interrupts could go through, which prevented qemu from closing.

Problem: When reading and printing the binary files, the ELF string at the
beginning wasn't showing up. However, reading the text files was working just
fine. The reason was that the terminal driver still wasn't working yet, and
when printing characters it wrote over the ELF string. This wasn't an issue
with text files because each line ends with a newline character. The solution
was just to merge with the terminal driver code.

Problem: After making some changes to the keyboard driver, the text was working
when typing in lower case letters, but when the shift/capslock/alt key was pressed
it would stop working completely.
Solution: The function handling the interrupt sets the interrupt flag and sends the
PIC and EOI signal at the end. However, certain keys caused the function to return
earlier and I forgot to reenable interrupts and send the EOI in this case. The fix
was to add these lines wherever the function returned.

Buglog (Ben):

Problem: sudo: unable to execute ./debug.sh: No such file or directory
Solution: Piazza -> dos2unix debug.sh; chmod +x debug.sh; make clean; make;

Problem Keyboard wasnt printing anything
Solution: Added James' RTC files and called test_interrupt in tests.c

Problem RTC handler not being called
Solution: problem with send_eoi in i8259.c worked after fixing

Problem: rtc_write, dereferencing void* pointer, void value not ignored compiler message
Solution: *((int*)buf) needed to cast the void pointer to a pointer type then dereference

Problem: Keyboard prints a random character after the pressed character
Solution: Make sure keyboard doesn't read the scancode of the release

Buglog (Jin)

Problem: compiler error "undefined reference" error with "collect 2: ld returned 1 exit status" in idt_init.c 
The linkage error was kept appearing during compile. 
Solution: Piazza post helped find the solution that the error may be caused by unincluded header file. 
Included the right header file and error disappeared. 

Problem: "Ignoring packet error " when using target remote to test_debug with gdb on Devel. 
Solution: It was normal error and piazza post explained that closing and reopening test_debug 
while still in gdb command line on devel. Reopend test_debug and redid target remote to boot the OS.
